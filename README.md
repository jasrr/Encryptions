#Streaming Content Encryption and Protection

This repository explores the similar or basic encryption and protection mechanisms.
so we'll start by goin through the basica how major streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Spotify uses encryption for their contents. The focus is on the technical implementation of content security, DRM (Digital Rights Management), and secure playback.

##Video Streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video)

###Encryption Process

> Content stored unencrypted on servers
> AES-128 encryption applied before distribution

###Client-Side Implementation

1-Download Process:

> User initiates content download
> Encrypted content transferred to client device
> Content stored in encrypted form (e.g., encrypted chunks)


2-DRM Integration:

>App communicates with DRM server (e.g., Widevine, PlayReady)
>DRM server generates and transmits license key
>License key securely stored in device's secure enclave


3-Playback Mechanism:

> Real-time decryption using stored license key
> Content decrypted in memory during playback
> Only currently playing segments decrypted, maintaining protection
